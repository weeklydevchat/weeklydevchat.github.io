# Bold Predictions for 2026

During our [January 13, 2026 Weekly Dev Chat session](posts/2026/01/13/index.md), participants made their bold predictions for the year ahead.  Check back next year to see how many of these predictions came true!

## AI & Machine Learning

**Chris C**: Chinese and other non-American AI models are becoming cheaper and better, and will start eating away at American AI models.

**Chris C**: A local AI model will be released for a desktop OS or phone that will be reasonably good.

**Harold**: Creative AI that can come up with ideas it was not trained on.

## Hardware & Infrastructure

**Bobby**: NVIDIA graphics cards will go up in price.

**Chris C**: The opposite - NVIDIA graphics cards will go down in price. Data centres are being overbuilt and that will cause an oversupply of chips.

**Harold**: Data centre in a non-obvious location such as space or ocean.

## Operating Systems & Platforms

**Omar**: Linux desktop usage will increase.

## Developer Tools & Platforms

**Norman**: Stack Overflow will go out of business this year.

**Andrew**: GitHub has peaked and usage will drop.
