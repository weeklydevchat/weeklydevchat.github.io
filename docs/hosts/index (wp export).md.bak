#### A casual weekly virtual chat mostly focused on web and software development

Weekly Dev Chat is a place to ask questions, hear different viewpoints, and get to know your fellow developers. Every week there is an initial topic posted to get the discussion started. Sometimes we discuss the initial topic the entire chat, and other times the topic changes several times through the natural flow of the conversation.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others.

## How to Join the Weekly Dev Chat

#### The short version

1. Install [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).

3. Find the meeting link on the [#meetup-weekly-dev-chat](https://devedmonton.slack.com/archives/C01LZQ6550V) channel on Dev Edmonton [Slack](https://devedmonton.com/#about-our-slack).

The Weekly Dev Chat uses [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). If you don't want to install Zoom you can use it directly in your [browser](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362593-Join-My-Meeting-via-Browser) instead.

The recommended way for getting the link for the Zoom meeting is by joining the Dev Edmonton [Slack](https://devedmonton.com/#about-our-slack). The link will be posted every week in the #meetup-weekly-dev-chat channel. The #meetup-weekly-dev-chat channel is where you can post an initial topic suggestion. It is also used to continue the discussion once the chat is over.

You can join the Dev Edmonton Slack even if you don't live in Edmonton and it's free to join. Details on how to join the Dev Edmonton Slack and the organization can be found on their [website](https://devedmonton.com/).

A second option is to join the Edmonton Unlimited Meetup [group](https://www.meetup.com/startupedmonton/). Once you join the group look for the Weekly Dev Chat event and the Zoom link will be shown when you register for the event.

## Norm Lorrain

I have degrees in EE and CS and have worked in industries from broadcast communications to nuclear power to SCADA. Currently call myself semi-retired, working part-time as an IT manager at a local healthcare clinic. Our first computer was a Heathkit HS-151, in 1984, programmed in GW-Basic and Turbo Pascal. My first IT summer job was writing Cobol code on an HP mainframe terminal. I love to work with embedded systems and have worked mostly in C and C++. These days I usually program in Python. I'm curious about many things; YouTube's algorithm has a hard time with me üòè.
