# Every Tuesday at 12pm Mountain Time

A casual weekly [virtual chat](join.md) mostly focused on web and software development.

Weekly Dev Chat is a place to ask questions, hear different viewpoints, and get to know your fellow developers. Every week there is an initial topic posted to get the discussion started. Sometimes we discuss the initial topic the entire chat, and other times the topic changes several times through the natural flow of the conversation.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](join.md) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others.
