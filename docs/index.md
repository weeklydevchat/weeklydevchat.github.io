A casual weekly virtual chat mostly focused on web and software development

Weekly Dev Chat is a place to ask questions, hear different viewpoints, and get to know your fellow developers. Every week there is an initial topic posted to get the discussion started. Sometimes we discuss the initial topic the entire chat, and other times the topic changes several times through the natural flow of the conversation.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others.

I have degrees in EE and CS and have worked in industries from broadcast communications to nuclear power to SCADA. Currently call myself semi-retired, working part-time as an IT manager at a local healthcare clinic. Our first computer was a Heathkit HS-151, in 1984, programmed in GW-Basic and Turbo Pascal. My first IT summer job was writing Cobol code on an HP mainframe terminal. I love to work with embedded systems and have worked mostly in C and C++. These days I usually program in Python. I'm curious about many things; YouTube's algorithm has a hard time with me ![😏](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/svg/1f60f.svg).
