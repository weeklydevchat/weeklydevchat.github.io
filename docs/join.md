# How to join the weekly dev chat:

#### The short version

1.  Install [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).
2.  Find the meeting link on the [#meetup-weekly-dev-chat](https://devedmonton.slack.com/archives/C01LZQ6550V) channel on Dev Edmonton [Slack](https://devedmonton.com/#about-our-slack).
3.  Alternatively find the link on Weekly Dev Chat event on the Edmonton Unlimited's Meetup [group](https://www.meetup.com/startupedmonton/).

#### The longer version

The Weekly Dev Chat uses [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). If you don't want to install Zoom you can use it directly in your [browser](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362593-Join-My-Meeting-via-Browser) instead.

The recommended way for getting the link for the Zoom meeting is by joining the Dev Edmonton [Slack](https://devedmonton.com/#about-our-slack). The link will be posted every week in the #meetup-weekly-dev-chat channel. The #meetup-weekly-dev-chat channel is where you can post an initial topic suggestion. It is also used to continue the discussion once the chat is over.

You can join the Dev Edmonton Slack even if you don't live in Edmonton and it's free to join. Details on how to join the Dev Edmonton Slack and the organization can be found on their [website](https://devedmonton.com/).

A second option is to join the Edmonton Unlimited Meetup [group](https://www.meetup.com/startupedmonton/). Once you join the group look for the Weekly Dev Chat event and the Zoom link will be shown when you register for the event.
