## Dale Hagglund

My first paid programming job was a summer job for my high school, from which I learned that (a) good variable names are important, (b), algorithms are cool, and (c) you shouldn't bid a fixed-price contract. After high school, I received as B.Sc. in Computer Science (1986) from the University of Alberta and an M.Sc. in Computer Science (1988) from the University of Victoria.</p><p>I have worked on “close-to-the-hardware” projects including high-performance networking, i/o, and computing systems for most of my career. However, I am now at INVIDI Technologies working on software to help content distributors and providers make the best use of their available ad spots.

I enjoy writing software and talking and thinking about how to write software better.

## Birm Wais

I got into programming because I wanted to build an app for this startup idea I had. Turned out the app idea was terrible, but learning to code wasn't. I'm still hacking around on projects and attempting to build Startups, but I also work as a full-stack developer at Punchcard Systems.
