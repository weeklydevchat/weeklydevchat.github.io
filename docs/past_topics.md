Today's (Apr 30th) Weekly Dev Chat topic is setting up a Nuxt development environment. I think it's a Node/Vue, or similar technology. Inspired by the upcoming JavaScript/Python/Ruby meetup that is all about contributing to the Dev Edmonton website. Looking for tips on creating my own development environment, what IDEs people use, and any other tips.

Good morning! Today's (Feb 27th) Weekly Dev Chat initial topic is a deep dive into Git. I'll be sharing my screen and we can discuss how Git works, Git commands, and some best practices. Inspired by pretty much everyone who asked for it the past couple of chats.

This chat will be a bit different as I'll be sharing my screen sometimes so we can see VS Code in action. I might look for another person or two to share their screen if we have lots of people attend and need breakout rooms.

Morning! Today‚Äôs initial topic for the Weekly Dev Chat is once again on productivity tools! This was inspired by a couple of suggested topics such as wanting to talk about AI-powered tools (Copilot, Jetbrains AI) or specifically note-taking apps (like, Obsidian). Since it is a new year, why not talk all about tools we‚Äôre using in 2024 (AI-powered or not).

Hello everyone! I hope you are having a great day so far. The initial topic for today's (Dec 5th) Weekly Dev Chat is Advent of Code. Actually, that is not really true because I'm going to try something different for today's Weekly Dev Chat. Instead of just chatting we will try mob programming to solve one or two of the Advent of Code challenges.
