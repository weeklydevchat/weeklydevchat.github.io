We will be doing some pair practice hacking using [PicoCTF gym](https://picoctf.org/index.html#picogym). No need to create your own PicoCTF account unless you want too.  I'll be sharing my screen and we will work together to solve some PicoCTF examples.

September's security theme schedule:

- Sep 3rd: [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). Focus on how to prevent the issues listed.

- Sep 10th: [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) exercises.

- Sept 17th: Privacy. Does it matter anymore? What to store, not to store.

- Sep 24th: Live from [BSides](https://www.bsidesedmonton.org/) (maybe?)

Learn how to join the chat, and other useful information, [here](https://weeklydevchat.com/). Everyone and anyone is welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others.
