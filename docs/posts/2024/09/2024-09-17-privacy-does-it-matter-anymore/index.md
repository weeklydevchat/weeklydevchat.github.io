In this chat we will discuss privacy and if people think it matters anymore. I figure by now all my personal information is already out there (e.g. credit card, SIN, names, etc) that it doesn't matter anymore but I'm likely mistaken.

Less click-baity is the topic of data retention. What should be stored? Where to store it? How to safely delete data?

September's security theme schedule:

- Sep 3rd: [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). Focus on how to prevent the issues listed.

- Sep 10th: [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) exercises.

- Sept 17th: Privacy. Does it matter anymore? What to store, not to store.

- Sep 24th: Live from [BSides](https://www.bsidesedmonton.org/) (maybe?)

Learn how to join the chat, and other useful information, [here](https://weeklydevchat.com/). Everyone and anyone is welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others.
