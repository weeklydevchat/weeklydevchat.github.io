What seeds have you planted in the past that you are now harvesting?  For example, any skills you spent the time mastering that are now paying off?  Any other past investments that you are now reaping the benefits of? 

Inspired by harvesting my IRL garden. Most of it harvested but I still need to dig up the potatoes and carrots for the upcoming Thanksgiving weekend.
