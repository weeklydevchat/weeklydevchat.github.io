# Giving, Generosity, and Kindness

The topic for this chat is giving, generosity, and kindness, inspired by the upcoming holidays.  What acts of kindness have you initiated or something kind someone did for you?  Something that made yours, or someone else’s, life better.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Learn how to join the chat, and other useful information, here.

P.S. – This is the last Weekly Dev Chat of 2024.  The 24th and 31st chats are cancelled due to the holidays. We will return Jan 7th, 2025.
