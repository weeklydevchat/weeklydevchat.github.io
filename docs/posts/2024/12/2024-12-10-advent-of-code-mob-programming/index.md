Happy December everyone!  I am back from the brown desert to a white snowy Alberta.  Seeing Christmas decorations without snow next to a palm tree was cool but also hard on my Northern Canadian brain.

The topic for today's chat is the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).  I'll share my screen and we will jointly try to solve a couple of the problems.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Learn how to join the chat, and other useful information, [here](https://weeklydevchat.com/).

P.S. - Special thanks to Norman for hosting last week's (2024-12-03) chat at the last minute!
