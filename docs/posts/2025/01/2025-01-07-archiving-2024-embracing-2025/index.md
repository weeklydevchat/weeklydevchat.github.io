The New Year is a global reset. Like getting a new computer and deciding what applications are worth reinstalling and picking new applications to try for the first time. Archiving the work you want to keep and letting go of files that no longer benefit you when you reformat your hard drive.

In this chat we will reflect on 2024 and what we are looking forward to in 2025. Was 2024 a good year for you? Why or why not? What are your plans for 2025? Any goals or resolutions? The usual New Year's questions.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Learn how to join the chat, and other useful information,Â [here](https://weeklydevchat.com/).
