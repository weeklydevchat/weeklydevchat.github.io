In this chat we will review some 2024 developer’s surveys and then make our own bold developer and technology predictions for 2025. What do you think will happen in 2025? How much of an impact will AI have this year? Will a big tech company fail this year and/or will a new big tech company raise up? What new hardware will come out this year? Will a new job title be created this year, such as how prompt engineer became a job title last year?

What is your bold prediction?
