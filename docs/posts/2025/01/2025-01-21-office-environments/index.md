Good morning Dev Edmonton! I'm pleased to host today's meeting. Today #meetup-weekly-dev-chat will be talking about office environments.

What's your current workplace situation? What's been your best experience? Worst?

What would you prefer:

- open floor? cube farm? private office?

- remote/hybrid/onsite?

- pack a lunch/cafeteria/nearby restaurants?

- background music? headphones?

- desktop or laptop?

- one/two/n screens?

Is your home computer more powerful than what the company provides?

Where is office life heading?

Everyone and anyone is welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted shortly before 12pm MDT.
