Join the Weekly Dev Chat on Jan 28th, 2025 for some ensemble hacking on the PicoCTF platform. The goal is to solve one problem, but if things go well, maybe we can solve a couple. Like previous ensemble sessions, I will share my screen and get suggestions from you, the ensemble, on how to solve the problem.

PicoCTF: [https://picoctf.org/](https://picoctf.org/)

Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Learn how to join the chat, and other useful information, [here](https://weeklydevchat.com/).

P.S. - I love the retro feel of the AI generated image for today's chat.
