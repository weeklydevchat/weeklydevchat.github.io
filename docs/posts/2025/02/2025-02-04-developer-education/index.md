Good morning Dev Edmonton! I'm pleased to host today's meeting. Today #meetup-weekly-dev-chat will be talking about developer education.

Did your training prepare you for what you're doing? Did you take a traditional, formal route or an alternative one? What about your colleagues? If you had to do it over again what would you do?

How do you keep up with current trends? Corporate training or on your own? Are credentials important?

Did you specialize or generalize? What trends do you see?

Everyone and anyone is welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted shortly before 12pm MDT.
