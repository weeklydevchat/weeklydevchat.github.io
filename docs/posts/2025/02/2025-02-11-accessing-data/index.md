The topic for the today's Weekly Dev Chat (Feb 11) is accessing data. How do you access the data your application needs, such as an ORM, raw SQL, 3rd party APIs, something else? Are you responsible for the security of the data, or is that someone else in your organization? How do you make sure data is shown to the correct users and not leaked?
Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others.  Zoom link will be posted at 12pm Mountain Time.
