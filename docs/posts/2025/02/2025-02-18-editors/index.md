I'm curious about how other people get their work done, so in today's #meetup-weekly-dev-chat we'll be talking about editors, IDEs, and plugins.

What's your setup?  Your favourite plugin?  On a fresh machine what's the first thing you install? Does your company allow you to choose your editing tools?  Do you use Copilot or some other AI assist? Coding standards? Linting? What do you love, what do you hate?

Everyone and anyone is welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted shortly before 12pm MDT.
