Good morning, Dev Edmonton! I’m pleased to host today’s meeting. For today’s #meetup-weekly-dev-chat, we’re having an 'unconference.' Instead of a formal topic, bring your own. Share questions, gripes, concerns, praises, beefs, or bouquets. It’s open and unscripted—real talk or silly, anything goes. Come ready to chat and riff off each other. You can get started by posting ideas below.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
