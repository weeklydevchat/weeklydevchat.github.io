In today's Weekly Dev Chat (March 18) we propose a hypothetical:

If given complete freedom, which project or undertaking would you work on at your current job? If not your current job, then as a personal project?

So, if you're currently working and you get your choice from the Jira buffet or you could propose a new ticket entirely, what would you go for?  And don’t worry, the boss is feeling extra persuadable today and there’s no need to time-box. Are you refactoring that entire 700,000-line enterprise codebase (finally)? Are you grabbing your designer to do a complete restart on that eye-bleeding UI/UX that you've had to look at for the past decade? If it's not in your current job, is there a project or learning endeavour you're dying to pursue if only there was more time in the day (or more of you)? Excited to see what's on your personal backlog.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm Mountain Time.
