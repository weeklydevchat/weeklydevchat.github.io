The topic for the 2025-04-15 chat is career twists and turns. Inspired by someone I know debating if they should take a position at a new company or stay with their current employer. That got me thinking about my own career path, and how 20-year-old me would never have guessed I would end up starting my own consulting business. 20-year-old me assumed I would be working in the game's industry.

Did your career path turn out how you imagined it when you were younger? For people just starting, where do you see yourself in five to ten years?
