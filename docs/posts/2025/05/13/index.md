TODO (this is Grok, for inspiration. edit/clarify/expand)

After years of training and possibly a decades-long career, do you think differently?

Do you approach non-coding problems like code? 

# Examples of Cognitive Changes
## Decomposition  
* Change: Breaking problems into parts, like modular code.  
* Example: A developer plans a trip by optimizing flights and lodging like program functions.  

Discussion Point: Does this streamline or overcomplicate planning?

## Pattern Recognition  
* Change: Coding involves spotting reusable patterns, like abstracting solutions.  

* Example: A developer might streamline repetitive workplace tasks, like standardizing meeting agendas, akin to a code library.  

Discussion Point: Does this skill help in non-technical trend-spotting?



## Debugging Mindset  
* Change: Systematic error-tracing from debugging.  
* Example: A developer troubleshoots a faulty device methodically, like debugging code.  
Discussion Point: Does this build resilience or lead to overthinking?
# Discussion Prompts


Are these shifts unique to coding?  

Do they hinder intuition or teamwork?
