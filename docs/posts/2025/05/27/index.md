![GitHub Copilot Agent in VS Code](2025-05-27.svg)

In today's (2025-05-27) post, we will play with the GitHub Copilot [Agent](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/) in Visual Studio Code.  The agent is different than Copilot Chat as the agent will run commands on your machine, including compiling the project, adding files/directories, and directly editing files.  

Will it do what we expect?  Let's find out!

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others.

P.S. - The image for this post was created using Claude 4.  I can't create png/jpg, at least not on the free account I'm using, but could create SVG.
