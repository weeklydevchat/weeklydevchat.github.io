When you start a new job, do you bring the habits and approaches you developed at your last workplace, or do you start fresh? Are those old habits holding you back or helping you shine in your new role?

Do you dive in and adapt to the team’s way of doing things, or do you try to share your own ideas and influence your new colleagues?

On the other hand, when you welcome a new team member, what do you expect? Should they follow the team’s lead, or can they bring new ideas to the table? How long does it take for them to really get up to speed?





Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
