What happens when you start a new job?  Do you bring the practices and habits you developed at your old organisation or do you start fresh? Is it baggage holding you back your something that helps enrich your new position?

Do you jump in with both feet or do you push back a bit and try to influence your new colleagues?  

On the other hand, when you bring on a new team member, what do you expect of them?  Do they toe the line? Can they teach your team any new tricks? How long does it take for a new member to get up to speed

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
