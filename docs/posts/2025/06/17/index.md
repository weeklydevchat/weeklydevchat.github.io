Summer is almost here, at least in the Edmonton area. Long sunny days and cool evenings that are perfect for outdoor activities. Which leads to the topic of the June 17th, 2025 Weekly Dev Chat: Do you change your software development routines in the summer?

Does your productivity increase or decrease during the summer? Do you let your computer collect dust in the basement, or do you bring it outside with you? How about on vacation?

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.

P.S. - ChatGPT created the attached image. It got the test correct, which is a big improvement from the previous versions.
