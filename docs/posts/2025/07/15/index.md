There are plenty of analogies comparing software development to art, to writing, bridge building, house construction, etc. I was out for a walk last night and noticed a lot of weeds taking over the neighbourhood.  This got me thinking about debugging as weeding. Sure enough, [I'm not alone](https://www.surton.com/software-is-a-garden/).  

Sometimes these analogies are helpful, sometimes not. What's your preferred analogy? How does it help? Where does it fall short?
