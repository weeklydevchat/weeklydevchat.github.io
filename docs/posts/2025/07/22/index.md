Prototyping is a vital tool for visualising ideas, collecting user feedback, and refining requirements. However, it may not always be essential, particularly in agile environments where iterative development is valued. Some questions that arise here are:

- What are the advantages of prototyping for user feedback and reducing risks?
- What are the challenges and limitations, such as time constraints and scope creep?
- How does prototyping integrate with agile methodologies?
- What are real-life examples of successful and unnecessary prototyping?
