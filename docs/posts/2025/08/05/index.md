For today’s #meetup-weekly-dev-chat we're going to open it up to anyone to bring a topic.  It should lean towards software development, but not necessarily.  Bring your questions, bring your answers.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
