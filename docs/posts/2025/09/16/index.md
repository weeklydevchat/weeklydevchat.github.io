Was Agile just a fad? Does anybody still care about patterns anymore? Does object-oriented design still matter? 

I was watching a video about [city architecture and the famous architect Christopher Alexander](https://youtu.be/150JBae2XtA), and it was interesting when they showed how he inspired software design patterns.  Alexander continues to influence building design; does the "[Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)" also have the same impact? How about the [Agile Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto)?  Did we go too far with OOD? Or... are these the foundations of software development?

Bonus question: What’s your experience with low-code/no-code platforms? Do they just offload software development to novices, or are they helpful to you?
