![2025-09-30 Header Image about Claude Code](2025-09-30-header.svg)

In today's (2025-09-30) chat we will experiment with [Claude Code 2.0](https://www.anthropic.com/news/enabling-claude-code-to-work-more-autonomously) and [Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5). Time permitting we might even try [Claude Imagine](https://youtu.be/dGiqrsv530Y).

I was planning on pairing with Claude Code as I just recently ponied up the money for the paid plan before the releases but that just cemented today's topic. What problem would you like to see Claude try to solve?

Everyone is welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.

P.S. - The header image was created with Claude.  Not as good as I would have liked.
