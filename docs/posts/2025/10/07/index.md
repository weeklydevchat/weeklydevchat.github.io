This month is Hacktoberfest, an annual (since 2014) celebration of open-source development. Are you taking part in it? Have you contributed to any open-source projects? Do you have any side projects of your own that you're looking for help with?

Do open-source contributions and your GitHub account look good on a resume?

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
