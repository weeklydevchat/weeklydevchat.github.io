This month Hacktoberfest, an annual (since 2014) celebration of open-source development.  Are you taking part in it?  Have you contributed to any open source projects? Do you have any side-projects of your own that you're looking for help with?

Do open-source contributions look good on a resume? Do you put your GitHub account on your resume?  

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
