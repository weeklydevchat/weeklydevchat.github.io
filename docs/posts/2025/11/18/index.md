This is a big topic! We can discuss change at the corporate/organizational level, or we can zoom in on controlling change in software development. I’ll leave it open for the group to steer the conversation. Controversial opinions welcome.

Anyone have horror stories? Boss drops a 500-page manual on your desk Friday afternoon and says “figure this new tool out by Monday”? You show up one morning and the entire phone system/email client/ERP has been replaced overnight with zero warning?

What about managing requirements? You work for weeks on a feature and it's suddenly dropped? Or a new requirement causes a major rewrite?

On version-control, we can also dig into trunk-based vs feature-branch workflows vs Git Flow, and when each actually makes sense. 

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
