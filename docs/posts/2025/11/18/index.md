This can be a big topic.  We can talk about change at a corportate/organisation level, or we can focus on controlling change in software development.  I'll leave it open for the group to drive the discussion.  Change is hard is a cliché but it's true.  Any horror stories of a boss dropping a manual on your desk and asking you to figure out a new tool?   Show up on Monday morning to a new phone system?  Or we can debate the merits of trunk-based, feature branch, etc. Somehwere in the middle we can cover managing changing customer requirements.

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
