The topic for today's (Dec 2, 2025) chat is Third Places (not home or work), specifically for developers and other technologists. Where do you go to interact with other developers? Why do you go there? Why do you not go?

Inspired by the Weekly Dev Chat starting to host more in real-life (IRL) events.

P.S. - The image was created by Claude and is it's second attempt after I asked it to make the first, really boring image, more exciting.
