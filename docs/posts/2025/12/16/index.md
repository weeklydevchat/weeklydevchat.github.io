The topic for the December 16th, 2025 chat is self-hosting. More and more developers are exploring it, but what are the benefits? Does it really improve security? And is the effort justified for a personal project or a small team?

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
