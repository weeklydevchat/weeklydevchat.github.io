This is our last meeting of the year. Looking back, what are your highlights? Disappointments?
Did you jump into the AI pool? Learn a new tool, framework, or language?
In your work, what was most annoying? What got in your way? What gave you the biggest boost in productivity? What was the most fun?
Did you get a promotion? Did you change roles?

Everyone and anyone are welcome to [join](https://weeklydevchat.com/join/) as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Zoom link will be posted at 12pm MDT.
