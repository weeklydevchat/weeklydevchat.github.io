# Developer Education 

The topic for this chat is developer education.  Did your education prepare you for what you're doing? Did you take a traditional, formal route or an alternative one? What have you seen in the field? If you had to do it over again what would you do?

How do you keep up with current trends? Corporate training or independent sources? Are credentials important? 

Do you specialize or generalize? Where is the future heading? 

Everyone and anyone are welcome to join as long as you are kind, supportive, and respectful of others. Learn how to join the chat, and other useful information, here.
