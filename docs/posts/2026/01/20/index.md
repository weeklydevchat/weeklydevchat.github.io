In today's (2026-01-20) chat we will discuss why you attend technical events.  I'm curious what makes you click the register button?  What makes an event worth your time, attention, and possibly money?  What makes you say "That event was totally worth it!" versus "That event was totally NOT worth it!".

Inspired by the WDC hosting more IRL events and looking for ideas to ~~steal~~ borrow.
