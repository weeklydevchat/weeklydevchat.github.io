Hello Hardware Swappers!

For those you for participating in the 1st ever [Swap Meet and Hardware Demo](https://luma.com/dbx9zrfr) hosted by the Weekly Dev Chat team!  Below are some notes mostly for people bringing items to sell but there is also advice that applies to everyone.

If you signed up for a table (PIN 3 or 4 ticket) you can show up between 6:30pm to 7:00pm to unload and set up.  If you signed up just to browse (PIN 1 or 2) please show up at 7:00pm or later unless you feel like helping us setup.

The buyer and seller are responsible for figuring out payment methods (e-transfer, cash, swap for other hardware, free, etc).  All sales are final by default.  I recommend sellers or buyers confirm the item works before the sale which might require brining a monitor, computer, and other items not for sale to demo the working item.

There is paid parking close to library and free parking in the neighbourhood if you don't mind walking a block or two.  Please read and obey all parking signs.

The Edmonton Strathcona Library is one of the oldest libraries in Alberta which means it looks cool, at least in my option, but has the downside of not being the most accessible.  The swap is on the 2nd floor of the library and their are stairs to get into the main door.  If you need to use the elevator it is on the side of the building.

Library Map (Accessibility Entrance on the side):

If you need a hand unloading or have any questions feel free to ping the Weekly Dev Chat team.

Looking forward to seeing you all tonight!
