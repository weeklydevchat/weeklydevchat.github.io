For those who are new to the term, it's similar to financial debt.  A project starts with a clean architecture and the best of intentions.  Over time, however, questionable decisions are made, changes are rushed through, process is undermined, and the codebase reaches a point where working with the code is more and more difficult.  Eventually we ask whether a complete rewrite is needed, sort of like declaring bankruptcy.

Have you seen technical debt? How do you deal with it? How do you prevent it?
