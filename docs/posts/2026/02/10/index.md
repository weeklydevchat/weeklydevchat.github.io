For those new to the term, *technical debt* is similar to financial debt. A project often starts with clean architecture and the best of intentions. Over time, however, questionable decisions creep in, changes get rushed, processes are undermined, and the codebase gradually becomes harder and harder to work with. Eventually, we reach the point of asking whether a complete rewrite is needed—sort of like declaring bankruptcy.

Have you encountered technical debt in your projects? How do you deal with it? How do you prevent (or at least manage) it?
