What is a feature, or two, that you wish existed in the language/framework/technology you are currently using?  Why do you miss it?  Does your current language/framework/technology have the feature but it's just implemented differently than you would like? 

Inspired by myself and Omar being newbies with Go and trying not to impose our habits from other languages without a good justification.  For example, we recently debated if we should use the [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) testing framework instead of Go's built in way to [testing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test).
