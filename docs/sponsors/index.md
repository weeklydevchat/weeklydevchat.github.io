# Help and Sponsorship

The best way you can help the Weekly Dev Chat is to attend the events as the kind, supportive, and respectful person you are. A close second is to share the Weekly Dev Chat with others who might benefit.

We also need volunteers to help with a variety of tasks from helping with events, admin work, website maintenance, social media, etc. If you are interested in volunteering, please reach out to Chris via email at <chris.cumming@saturdaymp.com>.

The final way you can help is by sponsoring SaturdayMP, the main Weekly Dev Chat sponsor, via GitHub [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/saturdaymp). Saturday MP pays for Zoom, hosting, food for in real life (IRL) events, and other expenses.

If you have any other ideas for helping Weekly Dev Chat please give [Chris](https://weeklydevchat.com/chris.cumming@saturdaymp.com) a shout. Thank you for your help and support, it is much appreciated.
